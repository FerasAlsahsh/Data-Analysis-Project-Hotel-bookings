![Housing Data Analysis](https://github.com/FerasAlsahsh/Data-Analysis-Project-Hotel-bookings/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-11-03%20192102.png)
This project is focused on handling messy data and applying data scaling techniques to standardize the data for analysis purposes. This notebook demonstrates key steps to clean, process, and scale data effectively. Below are the main components and explanations of each section.

---

## Project Overview

- **Language**: Python (using libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn)
- **Goal**: Clean messy data, handle missing values, and scale data for consistent analysis
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, pandas, scikit-learn

---

## Table of Contents

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Identifying and handling missing data
   - Removing or filling empty values
2. **Data Scaling**  
   - Explanation of different scaling techniques (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, etc.)
   - Applying scaling to numeric data for uniform analysis

---

## Instructions

To replicate the analysis, you will need:
1. **Python 3.x** and the following libraries:
   - `pandas`
   - `scikit-learn`
2. Run each cell in sequence for the correct results.
3. Adjust scaling techniques as necessary based on data distribution.

## Key Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning

- The initial data may contain missing or messy values.
- Steps to clean the data:
  - Drop columns or rows with excessive missing values.
  - Impute missing values using mean, median, or mode based on column characteristics.

### 2. Data Scaling

- Standardization and normalization methods are applied for data consistency.
- Types of scaling covered:
  - **StandardScaler**: Scales data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
  - **MinMaxScaler**: Scales data within a specified range, typically 0 to 1.
- Choosing the right scaling technique is essential for different models and datasets.

## Usage Example

```python
# Example code snippet for scaling data
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data)
